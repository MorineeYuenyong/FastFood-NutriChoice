# FastFood-NutriChoice
This project is a collaborative effort with a team. It focuses on utilizing data mining techniques to analyze data and provide actionable insights that help consumers make healthier choices when consuming fast food in a single meal. The analysis aims to determine whether consuming specific fast food items poses a risk of heart disease. Furthermore, it seeks to compare fast food data using two criteria: calorie content and energy-providing nutrient content, to evaluate their impact on consumer health. The results will identify similarities and differences in the outcomes of these two criteria.

### Project Scope
The project encompasses the following objectives:
1. **Correlation Analysis**  
   To investigate the relationship between nutrient content and calorie levels of fast food.
   
2. **Health Categorization Based on Calories**  
   To categorize fast food into health-related groups and recommend suitable food items for a single meal to promote good health based on calorie content.

3. **Health Categorization Based on Nutrient Content**  
   To categorize fast food into health-related groups and recommend suitable food items for a single meal to promote good health based on the energy-providing nutrient content.

4. **Heart Disease Risk Categorization**  
   To assess the risk of heart disease from consuming specific fast food items in a single meal by considering two key nutrient factors: saturated fat and cholesterol. Recommendations will be provided based on these factors.

The entire analysis will be conducted using **Python**.

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Health Categories**  
   Fast food items in a single meal will be classified into two health categories:  
   - **Healthy**  
   - **Unhealthy**  
   These classifications will be based on both calorie content and nutrient-based criteria.

2. **Heart Disease Risk Categories**  
   Fast food items in a single meal will be categorized into two risk levels:  
   - **Risk of Heart Disease**  
   - **No Risk of Heart Disease**  
   These classifications will be based on the levels of saturated fat and cholesterol in the fast food items.

The insights and recommendations generated through this project will enable consumers to make informed and healthier dietary choices when consuming fast food.
